Math Flash Card Training


A demonstration project for my course at Thinkful.com

A two view flash card math training app suitable for grade school students. Current
status is executing the code behind a wire framed layout.

Learning objectives at this point are:

1. Proper MVC design.  Learning to create model files and not do everything in a 
view controller.

2. Enabling persistence of user data between games with NSCoding.

3. Use of special event handlers like segues and user alrt views (UIAlertview).
